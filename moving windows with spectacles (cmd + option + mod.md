#### Workspace efficiency & optimization @ DBC
* saving small amounts of time repeatedly adds up to a lot of time
* automaticity & simplicity enable flow (translate your thoughts to text faster so that you can spend your focus on solving the interesting problems)

* moving windows with spectacles (cmd + option + modifier)
* **cmd + ~** (swap between different windows of an application)
* **cmd + shift + bracket** (swap between tabs in sublime, terminal, chrome. Use left bracket to go left, right bracket to go to the right)
* **cmd + enter** (insert a line below where the cursor is without moving whatever text may be to the right of the cursor (prevents having to go all the way to the right of a line before pressint enter))
**cmd + shift + enter** (insert a line above where the cursor is)

#### Sublime
* sublime panes
* multicursor (cmd+left mouse button (lmb), alt+lmb drag, cmd+d)
* word-wrap, reindent lines (comments set indent. level)
* moving cursor with alt+direction, cmd+direction

#### Misc
* terminal tabs & testing with terminal (I like to build things in small chunks before incorporating them into the program as a whole)!!
* pry vs irb (colors, pry-doc, www.sitepoint.com/rubyists-time-pry-irb/)
* sample working environment (quadrants)
* debuggers: byebug, binding.pry
